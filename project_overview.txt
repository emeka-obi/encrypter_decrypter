SCENARIO

World War 3: North Korea is desperately trying to remove all US military satellites off the earth's orbit, 
to prevent the united states from tracking the activites withtin the country. The first step taken by the 
United States is to 
encrypt all the information regarding longitude and charactersics of their satellites before further actions can be taken.
This software is capable of locating military satellites from a database (Kaggle) and encrypting all the information regarding 
the longtiude and charadcterstics of the satellite using AES-257 encryption algorithm.
Finally, the software allows the encrypted data to be easily dowbnloaded by the click of a button.
